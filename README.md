Research Portfolio: Bass Connections - Reconstructive Surgery Modeling

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Bass Connections research project on reconstructive surgery modeling. This repository serves as a portfolio to document the contributions I made to the work, analysis, and findings of this project.

üìå Project Overview

This research focuses on developing computational models to estimate the need for reconstructive surgery in Gaza in contect of the ongoing Palestininan conflict. The project integrates injury data, attack event classification, and predictive modeling to assess surgical needs post-conflict.

üìÇ Repository Structure

Data/ - Contains cleaned datasets used for analysis.

Models/ - Includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.

Reports/ - Documents findings, summaries, and research progress.

Miscellaneous/ - Other items related to this project.

README.md - This file, providing an overview of the repository.

üî¨ Research Objectives

Develop a multivariate regression model to predict injuries based on attack types.

Use open-source datasets (e.g. ACLED) and conflict reports to estimate reconstructive surgical needs.

Integrate real-world injury and conflict data to inform post-war reconstructive surgical need and medical delivery planning.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook for code compiling and data analysis

GitHub for version control and documentation

üì¢ Acknowledgments

This work is part of the Bass Connections project at Duke University, under the guidance of faculty mentors and in collaboration with healthcare professionals. I would especially like to thank Elaine Lin and Dr. Frances Hasso for their mentorship.
